This BANKING System is the Project of Technical Training Subject.

The key Features of Banking System in java are as follows : 
1. Database Connection: The program establishes a connection to a MySQL database with Java (JDBC).

2. User Interface: It creates a JFrame window for the banking system application with components like labels, text fields, password fields, buttons, and dialog boxes for user interaction.
The main frame allows users to log in with a username and password or create a new account.
Upon successful login, it opens a main menu frame with options to withdraw money, check balance, change password, deposit money, and go back to the login frame.

3. Database Operations: The program interacts with the database to perform operations such as validating user login credentials, creating new accounts, updating passwords, checking balances, and updating account balances after transactions (withdrawal or deposit).

4. Account Number Generation: It generates a random 6-digit account number for new accounts.

5. Event Handling: ActionListener interfaces are used to handle button clicks for login, account creation, and main menu options.
Dialog boxes are used to prompt users for input and display messages regarding account operations.
